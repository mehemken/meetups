- Description  
    Welcome to Cloud Ops 101!  
    A fortnightly meetup dedicated to learning the fundamentals of building and maintaining systems in the cloud. This meetup will host a study session every two weeks with a main focus on AWS certification exams. Bring your questions, ideas and insights! There are many services provided by AWS and your expertise may help others and vice versa. All levels are welcome. I'd like to build a welcoming group of folks who want to learn and help others learn. A rising tide floats all ships. Just bring your enthusiasm and perhaps your laptop.

    Agenda
    From 9am to 10am we will have a networking portion of the meetup. Use this segment of the meetup to find others with similar goals as yourself. They may become valuable contacts as you learn and seek new career opportunities.

    From 10 to 12 we will focus on the topic of the day. There will be a 20 to 30 minute presentation on a topic relevant to DevOps, SysOps, CloudOps etc. Then, depending on attendance, we will break out into study groups to focus on certification exams or learning a new technology. Don't feel pressured to stay the whole time but do stay as long as you want. When we're done, feel free to head on over to the beach. It should be nice and sunny.

    What to bring
    Bring yoruself, your challenges, your goals etc. A laptop might be helpful depending on what you hope to study A laptop might be helpful depending on what you hope to study.
